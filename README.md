\
**FinaPet** is a gamified personal finance app designed to help young adults build better saving habits through game mechanics, custom pets, and daily financial tracking. Developed as part of our team project, FinaPet combines financial literacy with engaging gameplay to make budgeting less stressful and more fun.

## Why We Built This

Many young adults, including us, struggle with keeping track of finances due to stress, lack of knowledge, or bad habits. Inspired by our own experiences and research, we designed FinaPet to make saving money feel less like a chore and more like playing a game.

## Tech Stack

- **Unity** for frontend UI and game logic
- **C#** for game scripts and logic
- **MySQL** for secure data storage
- **Apache Web Server** Serve as an API layer between the game and database, also contain scripts to run time-based operations
- **UnityWebRequest** for frontend-backend communication

---

## Custom Assets

We created all the in-game assets ourselves—this includes original artwork, animated sprites, and even custom background music. It was our first time designing and animating sprites, which made the experience both challenging and rewarding.

---

## Challenges

- **Database Hack**: We lost our initial setup and had to rebuild everything with better security.
- **Tech Stack Pivots**: Started with Supabase, switched to MySQL mid-way.
- **New to Unity**: We were complete beginners in Unity development and had to learn from scratch.
- **Game Balance**: Tuning reward mechanics without playtesting was tricky.

## What's Next

- **Procedural Pet Generation**: Mix and match pet body parts for unique combinations
- **Breeding & Growth**: Grow your pets and breed new ones
- **Leaderboards**: Track top savers and compete with friends
- **Social Aspects**: Visiting friend's home to view their pets etc.
- **Spending Categories**: Allocate and visualize budget segments (groceries, wants, transport, etc.)
- **Daily Financial Quizzes**: Learn while you save, with streaks and leaderboard boosts (think Duolingo!)

## Final Thoughts

FinaPet is more than a game—it’s our take on solving a real-world problem through creativity, technology, and personal reflection. We hope it inspires better financial habits in a way that feels rewarding and fun.
